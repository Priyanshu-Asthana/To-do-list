# To-Do List Website

A simple and intuitive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward interface to manage daily activities effectively.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list with a simple form.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to keep them up-to-date.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styles the web pages to make them visually appealing.
